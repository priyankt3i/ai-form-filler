1. Create the File Structure
First, create a folder on your computer named ai-form-filler. Inside this folder, create the files and folders as described below.

manifest.json: Copy the code from the manifest.json block and save it with this name in the root of your ai-form-filler folder.

popup.html: Copy the HTML and save it as popup.html in the same folder.

popup.js: Copy the JavaScript and save it as popup.js.

background.js: Copy the JavaScript and save it as background.js.

content.js: Copy the JavaScript and save it as content.js.

Icons Folder: Create a subfolder named icons. You'll need to create or download three simple .png icons and name them icon16.png, icon48.png, and icon128.png. You can easily create these with any image editor or find placeholder icons online.

Your final folder structure should look like this:

ai-form-filler/
├── manifest.json
├── popup.html
├── popup.js
├── background.js
├── content.js
└── icons/
    ├── icon16.png
    ├── icon48.png
    └── icon128.png

2. Load the Extension in Your Browser (Chrome/Edge)
Open your browser and navigate to the extensions page.

Chrome: chrome://extensions

Edge: edge://extensions

Turn on "Developer mode". You'll usually find this as a toggle switch in the top-right corner of the page.

Click the "Load unpacked" button.

A file dialog will open. Navigate to and select your ai-form-filler folder.

If everything is correct, the "AI Contextual Form Filler" extension will appear in your list of extensions.

3. How to Use It
Pin the extension to your toolbar for easy access.

Navigate to any webpage with a form (e.g., a registration page, a checkout page).

Click on the extension's icon in your toolbar.

Click the "Fill Form" button in the popup.

Watch as the extension analyzes the form, communicates with the AI, and fills in the fields with logically consistent data.

Next Steps and Advanced Features
This code provides a robust foundation. Here's how you can build upon it to implement the more advanced features from your request:

"Try Until Submit Enabled": In content.js, you could create a function that checks the disabled property of the submit button (document.querySelector('button[type="submit"]').disabled). If it's disabled after the first fill, you could have a "Randomize Dropdowns" button in your popup.html that triggers a function to only change <select> values and re-check the submit button.

Post-Submit Error Verification: After a user clicks the real submit button, your content.js could listen for a page navigation event. If the URL doesn't change after a few seconds and an element with a class like .error-message or .alert-danger appears, you can assume the submission failed. You could then trigger a notification or automatically try a new data combination.

Handling Complex Inputs: Modern websites use complex date-picker widgets or custom dropdowns that aren't standard HTML elements. You would need to write custom logic in content.js to identify and interact with these specific components, which often requires inspecting the site's unique HTML structure.

You now have a working prototype of a highly intelligent form-filling assistant. Happy testing!
